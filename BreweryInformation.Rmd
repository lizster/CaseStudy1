#Merge beer data with the breweries data.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
names(beer)[5]<- "Brew_ID" #making the merged columns the same

names(totalbeerinfo[2]) <- "BeerName" #changing this column to BeerName
names(totalbeerinfo[8]) <- "BreweryName"#changing this coloumn to BreweryName
head(totalbeerinfo, 6)
tail(totalbeerinfo, 6)
```
#Report the number of NAs in each column
```{r, echo=TRUE}
for (i in 1:10){
  print(paste(names(totalbeerinfo)[i],":", sum(is.na(totalbeerinfo[,i]))))}
#the issue with this one is that they are all separated by quotes
```

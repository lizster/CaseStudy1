# Case Study 1  
## Partners: Lizzy Sterling and Andrew Walch  
The questions answered in this repository are:  
1. How many breweries are present in each state?  
2. Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.   
3. Report the number of NA's in each column.  
4. Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot
a bar chart to compare.  
5. Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?  
6. Summary statistics for the ABV variable.  
7. Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.  

## Analysis Directory  
This directory contains all information regarding gathering and analyzing data regarding `beers` and `breweries`

## Distribution of Work  
While we both contributed separate codes, they both come to the same conclusions, just in different ways. These differences can be found within the codebook.  

*Lizzy*: combined relevant code and output along with the answers to the seven questions to generate an RMarkdown document with a correpsonding markdown file to present the findings in a reasonable fashion. (`BreweryInformation.rmd` and `BreweryInformation.md`)


*Andrew*: Combined our codes to come up with a master mark down file for the case study codebook (Case_study_CodeBook.rmd) and creawted a combined Brewery_and_Beer_Clean excel file. I coordinated serveral different meet up time to ensure project was on track and a success.
